# Employee Insights: Performance, Engagement & Training Analysis
The Power BI dashboard provides workforce insights, including employee count, gender ratio, job roles, performance ratings, and salary zones. It also features an individual employee report survey and training analysis to assess engagement and skill development.


The Power BI dashboard provides an overview of employee insights, including total employees, gender distribution, active vs. terminated employees, and performance ratings. Key bar charts show employees by department (Production dominates), designation (most are Production Technicians), and performance ratings (majority meet expectations). Pie charts highlight employment types (full-time, contract, part-time) and salary zones (evenly distributed). The dashboard allows filtering by business units to analyze specific workforce segments.

Additionally, I have created an individual employee details report in a separate section, providing deeper insights into each employee's profile. The final report includes details of a survey conducted for employees and an analysis of training programs, helping to understand workforce engagement and skill development trends.
